This is a fork of [The Old Reader (Dark and Blue) Quick FIX](http://userstyles.org/styles/109766/the-old-reader-dark-and-blue-quick-fix) Which is a fork of

[The Old Reader (theoldreader.com) (Dark and Blue)](http://userstyles.org/styles/89607/the-old-reader-theoldreader-com-dark-and-blue) that prompted me to start this.

I have borrowed some text style from [The Old Reader Dark](http://userstyles.org/styles/106898/the-old-reader-dark) for read and unread text color

The optional social link option was provided by [The Old Reader - Hide Sidebar Social Links](https://userstyles.org/styles/85068/the-old-reader-hide-sidebar-social-links)

The hover bar option was provided by [The Old Reader - Compact and Hover Menu](https://userstyles.org/styles/86403/the-old-reader-compact-and-hover-menu)
